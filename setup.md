### Download the Face13 sample dataset

- The Face13 tutorial dataset can be downloaded from this [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xq85woDpAYXhCtzdgjkXpjjjggiWSKtc). Download the `sourcedata` folder from the drive. This folder contains the raw EEG data, standard montages that are used during initialization, and task information.

- To run through this EEGLAB tutorial, the data needs to be initialized and in the BIDS standard. The steps to prepare data for running through this tutorial can be found in the [BIDS-EEG-EEGLAB tutorial](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-EEGLAB/). The BIDS-EEG-EEGLAB tutorial needs to be completed prior to this EEGLAB tutorial.
