> ## Prerequisites
>
> EEGLAB runs within Matlab so this lesson requires Matlab to be installed and for a recent version of EEGLAB to be available on the laptop. Although some familiarity with Matlab is helpful this lesson does not make assumptions on previous working knowledge of using Matlab at the Command Line.
