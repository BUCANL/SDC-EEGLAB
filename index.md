> ## Prerequisites
>
> * EEGLAB runs within Matlab so this lesson requires Matlab to be installed. Although some familiarity with Matlab is helpful this lesson does not make assumptions on previous working knowledge of using Matlab at the Command Line.
>
> * This lesson requires that data is initalized and in the BIDS standard. The steps to download and prepare the data can be found in the [BIDS-EEG-EEGLAB tutorial](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-EEG-EEGLAB/).
>
> * A recent version of EEGLAB is required for this tutorial and will be downloaded during the [BIDS-EEG-EEGLAB tutorial](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-EEG-EEGLAB/).
